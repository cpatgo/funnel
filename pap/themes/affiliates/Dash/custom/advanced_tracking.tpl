	Our affiliate program provides tools for advanced tracking of the traffic you send to us.
	This is sometimes called SubId tracking, or Ad channel tracking, it is used to know exactly which of your promotion efforts pay off and which do not.
	</p>
	<h2>Channels</h2>
	<p>
	Channels are the most simple and powerful way to control your traffic.
	To use it, simply create a new channel for every link/banner placement you want. For example, you can create channel for your home page, for second page, for AdWords advertisement.
	When getting banners and links you can choose to get the version with channel parameter appended. Now the channel will be saved for every click on this link, and the channel information will be transferred also  to the referred commission, so you will know exactly what link from which channel led to the commission.
	</p>
	<h3>Examples of use:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Testing the best placement for the banner on your website</strong> - you can use the same banner, but with different channel for every position - and you will know which one is clicked more or has better CTR.</li>
		<li><strong>PPC campaigns</strong> - you can have multiple advertisements using  the same affiliate link. By using channel unique for every advertisement you can find out which ones are more effective and have better conversion rate.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Additional parameters tracking</h2>
	<p>
	Except channels, you can append up to two custom parameters <strong>data1</strong> and <strong>data2</strong> to the link URL for additional tracking.
	These parameters will be transferred also to the tracked commission, so you will know exactly what link led to the commission.
	Example link with additional parameters:
	http://www.yoursite.com/?ref=fgdf&<strong>data1=xyz</strong>&<strong>data2=abcd</strong>
