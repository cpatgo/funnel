	The program is powered by <strong>{$postAffiliatePro}</strong>, the leading affiliate tracking software. {$postAffiliatePro} uses combination of cookies and IP address to track referrals for best possible reliability. When the visitor follows your affiliate link to our site, our affiliate system registers this referral and places cookie on his or her computer. When the visitor pays for the product, affiliate system checks for cookie (if not found, checks for IP address of referral) and credits your account with commission. <br/>
