This structure defines tiers from right to left, meaning the first one from left is top tier, then their child, then grandchild etc... The missing tier commission <strong>always goes to the parent affiliate</strong> (from right to left).<br /><br />E.g. in case of five levels %2-%2-%2-%4-%5 the commission structure changes like this, if the last affiliate is missing:<br />
                All 5 tiers: %2-%2-%2-%4-%5<br />
                4 tiers: %2-%2-%2-%9<br />
                3 tiers: %2-%2-%11<br />
                2 tiers: %2-%13<br />
