How it works:
%s
%sIf customer is referred by an affiliate for the first time, the plugin will store the relation between customer (his identifier) and affiliate into the database%s
%sNext time, when the same customer makes a sale (with the same identifier), the application will find the affiliate who originally referred him, and give him commission%s
%sIf no affiliate is found, the process goes normally, so it tries to recognize affiliate from cookie, etc.%s";"S";"";"N";"N"
