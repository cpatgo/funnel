If that were to happen, we would not be able to provide the learning center to our customers and we would not be able to pay commissions to our affiliates.  Rather than risk hurting our customers and our affiliates, we have decided to accept only the three payment methods used on our marketing site.

						The answer is “YES”. Our Independent Affiliate Rewards Program is a salescommission program and is based on you working with your enroller and other team members to earn a commission. Our subscription is a one-time sale and the company is only able to make money and provide you with commissions, if there are new sales. Each person signing up as an affiliate is required to sell 2 subscriptions. To continually earn commissions, you will need to sell at least 1 subscription every 6 months. When you begin as an affiliate depending upon which VIP subscription you purchased, you may have up to 30 days to make your first 2 subscription sales. Be sure to review the GLC Affiliate terms to make sure you understand how Our Affiliate Rewards Program works.

						The Global Learning Center is looking for affiliates who want to make money. Since our subscription is a one-time sale, we would not be in business very long if we paid commissions without subscriptions. While we expect that some affiliates will approach this opportunity with an all-out mentality, we also expect that some others who elect to become affiliates will do very little. Since our Independent Affiliate Rewards Program is based on an individual as well as a team concept, we have tried to strike a balance between the rewards for those who are going all-out and those who are doing very little. As an encouragement to keep our affiliates engaged, we have instituted a 2 subscription sales per 6 month rule.

						If your enroller is on a lower level than you are, you will still earn your commissions.  You should continue to work your business just as you would if your enroller was on a higher level than you.  As you and your enroller continue to work your business, eventually as you recycle and your enroller advances and recycles, you will automatically fill an open spot on your enrollers board.

						There are several things that the company has done to aid you in continuing to grow your business and receive commissions. The first thing is no one is permitted to hold more than one position in the company and on each level. This prevents a person from starting multiple boards, one or more of which could end up like a stepchild and get ignored.  Second, each time you recycle to a new board or advance to a new board, you join a board that already contains 3 people. In order for those people to advance, the team must make additional sales. Last, the system is designed to reward those who are working their business. If you are selling new subscriptions, for each 8 to 11 subscriptions you and your team sells, upon completion of the board you are on, you will recycle on that level and either advance to the next level or earn a commission. Lastly, those individuals who do not make at least 2 subscription sales every six months, are dropped from our system.

						At this time, Global Learning Center has decided not to accept payment using credit cards. A fast growing company such as Global Learning Center can have their funds held and/or charged back up to a period of 180 days. If that were to happen, we would not be able to provide the learning center to our customers and we would not be able to pay commissions to our affiliates. Rather than risk hurting our customers and our affiliates, we have decided to accept only the three payment methods used on our marketing site.

						Let’s review how a board works; whenever you land on a new board there will already be at least 3 Affiliates and there could be as many as 6 Affiliates on that board.  As you cycle through Step 1 to Step 2 to Step 3, it is possible that a board could appear to stall. However, that can only happen if all the members on that board stop working. As part of our Affiliate Rewards Program, each affiliate must sell at least 1 subscription every 6 months. This rule is to insure that a board never permanently stalls.

						Under the Affiliate Rewards program, each member is required to sell 2 or more VIP packages upon joining and every 6 months. If you did not complete this requirement that would be the reason that you did not receive your commission.
